## Application Idea
A niche version of Reddit but for sandwiches. 

## Key Features
Users sign up, login, upload recipes, make posts and comment posts.

## Remarks
This was my very first solo project, a lot of learning was done and consequently a lot of mistakes were madeðŸ˜‚
Feel free to check it out. The backend was moved to a separate repo which can be found on my profile. 
The backend was deployed using the free tier on Render and thus may be slow to respond due to the limitations of the free tier.

PS, I haven't haven't made any changes to the front end since 07 August 2024
