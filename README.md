## Application Idea
A niche version of Reddit but for sandwiches. 

## Key Features
Users can sign up, login, upload recipes, make posts and comment on posts.

## Remarks
This was my very first solo project, a lot of learning was done and consequently a lot of mistakes were madeðŸ˜‚.
Feel free to check it out. The backend was moved to a separate repo which can be found on my profile. It's called JJRSandwiches-Backend.
The backend was deployed using the free tier on Render and thus may be slow to respond due to the limitations of the free tier.

PS, I haven't made any changes to the front end since 07 August 2024. This was intentional

Special Thanks to my siblings for giving me the idea to work on. The first 3 letters in the name of the project are actually the initials of my siblings and I.
